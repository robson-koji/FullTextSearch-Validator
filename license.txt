"""Search query parser

version 2006-03-09

This search query parser uses the excellent Pyparsing module
(http://pyparsing.sourceforge.net/) to parse search queries by users.
It handles:

* 'and', 'or' and implicit 'and' operators;
* parentheses;
* quoted strings;
* wildcards at the end of a search term (help*);

Requirements:
* Python
* Pyparsing

If you run this script, it will perform a number of tests. To use is as a
module, you should use inheritance on the SearchQueryParser class and overwrite
the Get... methods. The ParserTest class gives a very simple example of how this
could work.

TODO:
- add more docs
- ask someone to check my English texts
- add more kinds of wildcards ('*' at the beginning and '*' inside a word)?
